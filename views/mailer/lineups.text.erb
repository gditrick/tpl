Hi <%= @team.owner_first_name %>,

<%= @week.description.possessive %> first games are fast approaching with a start time of
<%= @week.first_game_start.strftime("%A, %b %d, at %1I:%M %p %Z") %>.  If you are going to
play anyone in the first game(s) of the week, you must set those players in prior to the start
time of that game.

<% unless @season.quarters.nil? or @season.quarters.empty? %>

  <%= render :partial => "lineups_quarter.text.plain",
             :locals => { :team => @team,
                          :week => @week,
                          :previous_week => @previous_week,
                          :prize_definition => @prize_definition } %>
<% end %>

<% unless @season.halves.nil? or @season.halves.empty? %>

<%= render :partial => "lineups_half.text.plain",
           :locals => { :team => @team,
                        :week => @week,
                        :previous_week => @previous_week,
                        :prize_definition => @prize_definition } %>


<% end %>


<%= render :partial => "lineups_season.text.plain",
           :locals => { :team => @team,
                        :week => @week,
                        :previous_week => @previous_week,
                        :prize_definition => @prize_definition } %>


Don't forget each week if you get highest points you will win <%= @prize_definition.prize(WeekHighestScorePrize).amount_to_s %>

This also gives you a chance at the following prizes:

<% unless @season.quarters.nil? or @season.quarters.empty? %>
- Highest Total in a Quarter and win <%= @prize_definition.prize(QuarterHighestWeeklyScorePrize).amount_to_s %>

<% end %>
<% unless @season.halves.nil? or @season.halves.empty? %>
- Highest in a Half and win <%= @prize_definition.prize(HalfHighestWeeklyScorePrize).amount_to_s %>

<% end %>

- Highest Weekly in the Season and win <%= @prize_definition.prize(SeasonHighestWeeklyScorePrize).amount_to_s %>
